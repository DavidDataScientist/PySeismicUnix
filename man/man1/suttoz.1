.TH SUTTOZ 1 "suttoz" "CWP/SU" "Seismic Unix Manual"
.SH NAME
suttoz \- SUTTOZ - resample from time to depth
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B suttoz

\fBsuttoz\fR <stdin >stdout [optional parms]
.SH DESCRIPTION
SUTTOZ - resample from time to depth
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
nz=1+(nt-1)*dt*vmax/(2.0*dz)   number of depth samples in output
dz=vmin*dt/2		depth sampling interval (defaults avoids aliasing)
fz=v(ft)*ft/2		first depth sample
t=0.0,...		times corresponding to interval velocities in v
v=1500.0,...		interval velocities corresponding to times in v
vfile=		  binary (non-ascii) file containing velocities v(t)
verbose=0		>0 to print depth sampling information
.SH EXAMPLES
t=0.0,0.01,.2,... v=1500.0,1720.0,1833.5,... with the number of t values
equaling the number of v values. The velocities are linearly interpolated
to make a continuous, piecewise linear v(t) profile.
Linear interpolation and constant extrapolation is used to determine
interval velocities at times not specified.  Values specified in t
must increase monotonically.
Alternatively, interval velocities may be stored in a binary file
containing one velocity for every time sample.  If vfile is specified,
then the t and v arrays are ignored.
see selfdoc of suztot  for depth to time conversion
Trace header fields accessed:  ns, dt, and delrt
Trace header fields modified:  trid, ns, d1, and f1
.SH NOTES
Default value of nz set to avoid aliasing
The t and v arrays specify an interval velocity function of time.
Note that t and v are given  as arrays of floats separated by commas,
