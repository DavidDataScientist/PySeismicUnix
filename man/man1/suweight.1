.SH NAME
suweight \- SUWEIGHT - weight traces by header parameter, such as offset
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B suweight

\fBsuweight\fR < stdin > stdout [optional parameters]
.SH DESCRIPTION
SUWEIGHT - weight traces by header parameter, such as offset
.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
<none>
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
key=offset	keyword of header field to weight traces by
a=1.0		constant weighting parameter (see notes below)
b=.0005	variable weighting parameter (see notes below)
... or use values of a header field for the weighting ...
key2=		keyword of header field to draw weights from
scale=.0001	scale factor to apply to header field values
inv=0		weight by header value
=1 weight by inverse of header value
.SH NOTES
This code is initially written with offset weighting in mind, but may
be used for other, user-specified schemes.
The rationale for this program is to correct for unwanted linear
amplitude trends with offset prior to either CMP stacking or AVO work.
The code has to be edited should other functions of a keyword be required.
The default form of the weighting is to multiply the amplitudes of the
traces by a factor of:    ( a + b*keyword).
If key2=  header field is  set then this program uses the weighting
values read from that header field, instead. Note, that because most
header fields are integers, the scale=.0001 permits 10001 in the header
to represent 1.0001.
