.SH NOTES
Normalized CrossCorrelation sum: sum all possible crosscorrelation
trace pairs in a CMP gather for each trial velocity and zero-offset
two-way travel time inside a time window. This coherence measure is
normalized by dividing each crosscorrelation trace pair by the geometric
mean of the energy, inside the chosen time window, of each trace pair
involved in each crosscorrelation. Then, to achieve a maximum amplitude
of unity, the result is multiplied by  2/(M(M-1)), which is the inverse
of the total number of crosscorrelation. The normalization allows to
bring out weak reflection as long as these reflections have moveouts close
to a hyperbola.
