.TH SUFFT 1 "sufft" "CWP/SU" "Seismic Unix Manual"
.SH NAME
sufft \- SUFFT - fft real time traces to complex frequency traces suftt <stdin >sdout sign=1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sufft

suftt <stdin >sdout sign=1
.SH DESCRIPTION
SUFFT - fft real time traces to complex frequency traces suftt <stdin >sdout sign=1
.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
none
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
sign=1			sign in exponent of fft
dt=from header		sampling interval
verbose=1		=0 to stop advisory messages
Notes: To facilitate further processing, the sampling interval
in frequency and first frequency (0) are set in the
output header.
sufft | suifft is not quite a no-op since the trace
length will usually be longer due to fft padding.
Caveats:
No check is made that the data IS real time traces!
Output is type complex. To view amplitude, phase or real, imaginary
parts, use    suamp
