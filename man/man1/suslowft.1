.SH NAME
suslowft \- SUSLOWFT - Fourier Transforms by a (SLOW) DFT algorithm (Not an FFT) suslowft <stdin >sdout sign=1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B suslowft

\fBsuslowft\fR <stdin >sdout sign=1
.SH DESCRIPTION
SUSLOWFT - Fourier Transforms by a (SLOW) DFT algorithm (Not an FFT) suslowft <stdin >sdout sign=1
.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
none
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
sign=1			sign in exponent of fft
dt=from header		sampling interval
Trace header fields accessed: ns, dt
Trace header fields modified: ns, dt, trid
Notes: To facilitate further processing, the sampling interval
in frequency and first frequency (0) are set in the
output header.
Warning: This program is *not* fft based. Use only for demo
purposes, *not* for large data processing.
No check is made that the data are real time traces!
suslowft | suslowift is not quite a no-op since the trace
length will usually be longer due to fft padding.
Caveats:
No check is made that the data IS real time traces!
Output is type complex. To view amplitude, phase or real, imaginary
parts, use    suamp
