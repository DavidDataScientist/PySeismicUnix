.TH SUICLOGFFT 1 "suiclogfft" "CWP/SU" "Seismic Unix Manual"
.SH NAME
suiclogfft \- SUICLOGFFT - fft of complex log frequency traces to real time traces suiclogftt <stdin >sdout sign=-1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B suiclogfft

suiclogftt <stdin >sdout sign=-1
.SH DESCRIPTION
SUICLOGFFT - fft of complex log frequency traces to real time traces suiclogftt <stdin >sdout sign=-1
.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
none
Optional parameter:
sign=-1		sign in exponent of inverse fft
sym=0		=1 center  output
Output traces are normalized by 1/N where N is the fft size.
.SH EXAMPLES
suclogfft < shotgather | suamp mode=real | sustack key=dt > real.su
suclogfft < shotgather | suamp mode=imag | sustack key=dt > imag.su
suop2 real.su imag.su op=zipper | suiclogfft | suminphase > wavelet.su
.SH NOTES
Nominally this is the inverse to the complex log fft, but
suclogfft | suiclogfft is not quite a no-op since the trace
length will usually be longer due to fft padding.
