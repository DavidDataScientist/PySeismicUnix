.SH NAME
susvdfilt \- SUSVDFILT - SVD (Eigen) filter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B susvdfilt

\fBsusvdfilt\fR <stdin >stdout [optional parameters]
.SH DESCRIPTION
SUSVDFILT - SVD (Eigen) filter
.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
none
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
ntrw=all traces   number of traces in window
verbose=0	 1 = echo additional information
numpp=1	   number of principal planes to retain
subtract=1	subtarct selected principal planes from i/p
0	output selected principal planes
tmpdir=	   if non-empty, use the value as a directory path
prefix for storing temporary files; else if the
the CWP_TMPDIR environment variable is set use
its value for the path; else use tmpfile()
.SH NOTES
Input data is windowed to give an area of twlen x ntrw samples
which is then decomposed to into eigen vectors (by SVD) and
eigenvalues. A percentage of these are selected for inverse
transform this can be subtracted from input if difference is
required.
Caveat:
The pre-requiste is your target event has to be pre-flattened using NMO,
LMO or other static correction. Works well to remove direct wave from
marine seismic data for those of you interested in seismic oceanography.
The code really needs someone to make the windowing work in both time
and space. However as it stands it works, it has excellent amplitude
response and exhibits minimal edge effects.
