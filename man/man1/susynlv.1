susynlv \- SUSYNLV - SYNthetic seismograms for Linear Velocity function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B susynlv

\fBsusynlv\fR >outfile [optional parameters]
.SH DESCRIPTION
SUSYNLV - SYNthetic seismograms for Linear Velocity function
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
nt=101                 number of time samples
dt=0.04                time sampling interval (sec)
ft=0.0                 first time (sec)
kilounits=1            input length units are km or kilo-feet
=0 for m or ft
.SH NOTES
Offsets are signed - may be positive or negative.  Receiver locations
are computed by adding the signed offset to the source location.
Specify either midpoint sampling or shotpoint sampling, but not both.
If neither is specified, the default is the midpoint sampling above.
More than one ref (reflector) may be specified. Do this by putting
additional ref= entries on the commandline. When obliquity factors
are included, then only the left side of each reflector (as the x,z
reflector coordinates are traversed) is reflecting.  For example, if x
coordinates increase, then the top side of a reflector is reflecting.
Note that reflectors are encoded as quoted strings, with an optional
reflector amplitude: preceding the x,z coordinates of each reflector.
Default amplitude is 1.0 if amplitude: part of the string is omitted.
