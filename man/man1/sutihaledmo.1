\fBsutihaledmo\fR <infile >outfile [optional parameters]
.SH DESCRIPTION
SUTIHALEDMO - TI Hale Dip MoveOut (based on Hale's PhD thesis)
.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
nxmax		  maximum number of midpoints in common offset gather
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
option=1		1 = traditional Hale DMO (from PhD thesis)
2 = Bleistein's true amplitude DMO
3 = Bleistein's cos*cos weighted DMO
4 = Zhang's DMO
5 = Tsvankin's anisotropic DMO
6 = Tsvankin's VTI DMO weak anisotropy approximation
dx=50.		 midpoint sampling interval between traces
in a common offset gather.  (usually shot
interval in meters)
v=1500.0		velocity (in meters/sec)
(must enter a positive value for option=3)
(for excluding evanescent energy)
h=200.0		source-receiver half-offset (in meters)
ntpad=0		number of time samples to pad
nxpad=h/dx		number of midpoints to pad
file=vnmo		name of file with vnmo as a function of p
used for option=5--otherwise not used
(Generate this file by running program
sutivel with appropriate list of Thomsen's
parameters.)
e=0.			Thompsen's epsilon
d=0.			Thompsen's delta
.SH NOTES
This module assumes a single common offset gather after NMO is
to be input, DMO corrected, and output.  It is useful for computing
theoretical DMO impulse responses.  The Hale algorithm is
computationally intensive and not commonly used for bulk processing
of all of the offsets on a 2-D line as there are cheaper alternative
algorithms.  The Hale algorithm is commonly used in theoretical studies.
Bulk processing for multiple common offset gathers is typically done
using other modules.
