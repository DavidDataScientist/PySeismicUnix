.SH NAME
suphasevel \- SUPHASEVEL - Multi-mode PHASE VELocity dispersion map computed from shot record(s)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B suphasevel

\fBsuphasevel\fR <infile >outfile [optional parameters]
.SH DESCRIPTION
SUPHASEVEL - Multi-mode PHASE VELocity dispersion map computed from shot record(s)
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
fv=330	minimum phase velocity (m/s)
nv=100	number of phase velocities
dv=25		phase velocity step (m/s)
fmax=50	maximum frequency to process (Hz)
=0 process to nyquist
norm=0	do not normalize by amplitude spectrum
=1 normalize by amplitude spectrum
verbose=0	verbose = 1 echoes information
.SH NOTES
1. output is complex frequency data
2. offset header word must be set (signed offset is ok)
3. norm=1 tends to blow up aliasing and other artifacts
4. For correct suifft later, use fmax=0
5. For later processing outtrace.dt=domega
6. works for 2D or 3D shots in any offset order
Using this program:
First: use
suspecfx < shotrecord.su | suximage
to see what the maximum bandwidth is in your data. This will
give you an idea about the possible value for fmax.
Second: Plot your data or some subset of your data via:
suxwigb < shotrecord.su key=offset
You can then estimate the range of phase velocities by looking
at the maximum and minimum slopes of arrivals in your data.
This will allow you do set first velocity fv and the increment
in velocity dv, that make sense for your data.
You can pick values of offset and time by placing the cursor
on the desired location on the plot and pressing the 's' key
The picks will appear in your terminal window.
When displaying, don't forget to use suamp to compute the
modulus of the complex values that this program puts out.
suphasevel < shotrecord.su [parameters] | suamp | suximage
