.TH SUWFFT 1 "suwfft" "CWP/SU" "Seismic Unix Manual"
.SH NAME
suwfft \- SUWFFT - Weighted amplitude FFT with spectrum flattening 0->Nyquist suwfft <stdin | suifft >sdout
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B suwfft

SUWFFT - Weighted amplitude FFT with spectrum flattening 0->Nyquist
.SH DESCRIPTION
SUWFFT - Weighted amplitude FFT with spectrum flattening 0->Nyquist suwfft <stdin | suifft >sdout
.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
none
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
w0=0.75		weight for AmpSpectrum[f-df]
w1=1.00		weight for AmpSpectrum[f].. center value
w2=0.75		weight for AmpSpectrum[f+df]
.SH EXAMPLES
1. boost data bandwidth to 10-90 Hz
suwfft < data.su | suifft | sufilter f=5,8,90,100 | suximage
1. view amplitude spectrum after flattening
suwfft < data.su | suamp | suximage
Caveat: The process of cascading the forward and inverse Fourier
transforms may result in the output trace length being greater than
the input trace length owing to zero padding. The user may wish to
apply suwind to return the number of samples per trace to the original
value:  Here NS is the number of samples per trace on the original data
... | suwind itmax=NS | ...
.SH NOTES
1. output format is same as sufft
2. suwfft | suifft is not quite a no-op since the trace
length will usually be longer due to fft padding.
3. using w0=0 w1=1 w2=0  gives truly flat spectrum, for other
weight choices the spectrum retains some of its original topograpy
