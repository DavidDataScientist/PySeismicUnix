.SH NAME
sutxtaper \- SUTXTAPER - TAPER in (X,T) the edges of a data panel to zero
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sutxtaper

\fBsutxtaper\fR <stdin >stdout [optional parameters]
.SH DESCRIPTION
SUTXTAPER - TAPER in (X,T) the edges of a data panel to zero.
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
low=0.    	minimum amplitude factor of taper
tbeg=0    	length of taper (ms) at trace start
tend=0     	length of taper (ms) at trace end
taper=1       taper type
=1 linear (default)
=2 sine
=3 cosine
=4 gaussian (+/-3.8)
=5 gaussian (+/-2.0)
key=tr	set key to compute x-domain taper weights
default is using internal tracecount (tr)
tr1=0         number of traces to be tapered at beg (key=tr)
tr2=tr1       number of traces to be tapered at end (key=tr)
min=0.	minimum value of key where taper starts (amp=1.)
max=0.	maximum value of key where taper starts (amp=1.)
dx=1. 	length of taper (in key units)
if key=tr (unset) length is tr1 and (ntr-tr2)
.SH NOTES
Taper type is used for trace (x-domain) tapering as well
as for time domain tapering.
The taper is applied to all traces <tr1 (or key<min) and
>tr2 (or key >max) and all time samples <tbeg and >tend.
Taper weights are amp*1 for traces n tr1<n<tr2 and computed
for all other traces corresponding to the taper typ.
If key is given the taper length is defined by dx, otherwise
the length of taper is tr1 and (ntr-tr2) respectively.
To eliminate the taper, choose tbeg=0. and tend=0. and tr1=0
If key is set, min,max values take precedence over tr1,tr2.
