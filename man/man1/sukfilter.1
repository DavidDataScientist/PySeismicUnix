.SH NAME
sukfilter \- SUKFILTER - radially symmetric K-domain, sin^2-tapered, polygonal filter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sukfilter

\fBsukfilter\fR <infile >outfile [optional parameters]
.SH DESCRIPTION
SUKFILTER - radially symmetric K-domain, sin^2-tapered, polygonal filter
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
k=val1,val2,...	array of K filter wavenumbers
amps=a1,a2,...	array of K filter amplitudes
d1=tr.d1 or 1.0	sampling interval in first (fast) dimension
d2=tr.d1 or 1.0	sampling interval in second (slow) dimension
Defaults:
k=.10*(nyq),.15*(nyq),.45*(nyq),.50*(nyq)
amps=0.,1.,...,1.,0.  trapezoid-like bandpass filter
The nyquist wavenumbers, nyq=sqrt(nyq1^2 + nyq2^2) is  computed
internally.
.SH NOTES
The filter is assumed to be symmetric, to yield real output.
Because the data are assumed to be purely spatial (i.e. non-seismic),
the data are assumed to have trace id (30), corresponding to (z,x) data
The relation: w = 2 pi F is well known for frequency, but there
doesn't seem to be a commonly used letter corresponding to F for the
spatial conjugate transform variables.  We use K1 and K2 for this.
More specifically we assume a phase:
-i(k1 x1 + k2 x2) = -2 pi i(K1 x1 + K2 x2).
and K1, K2 define our respective wavenumbers.
