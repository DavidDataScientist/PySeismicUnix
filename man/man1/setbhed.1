.TH SETBHED 1 "setbhed" "CWP/SU" "Seismic Unix Manual"
.SH NAME
setbhed \- SETBHED - SET the fields in a SEGY Binary tape HEaDer file, as would be produced by segyread and segyhdrs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B setbhed

segyread tape=yourdata.segy bfile=yourdata.b > yourdata.su
.SH DESCRIPTION
SETBHED - SET the fields in a SEGY Binary tape HEaDer file, as would be produced by segyread and segyhdrs
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
bfile=binary		output binary tape header file
par=			=parfile
Set field by field, if desired:
jobid=			job id field
lino=			line number (only one line per reel)
reno=			reel number
format=			data format
... etc....
To set any binary header field, use sukeyword to find out
the appropriate keyword, then use the getpar form:
keyword=value	to set keyword to value
.SH EXAMPLES
segyread tape=yourdata.segy bfile=yourdata.b > yourdata.su
If
bhedtopar < yourdata.b | more
shows impossible values, then apply
swapbhed < yourdata.b > swapped.b
then apply
bhedtopar < swapped.b | more
bhedtopar < swapped.b outpar=parfile
hand edit parfile, and then apply
setbhed par=parfile bfile=swapped.b > new.b
then apply
segywrite tape=fixeddata.segy bfile=new.b < yourdata.su
Caveat: This program breaks if a "short" isn't 2 bytes since
the SEG-Y standard demands a 2 byte integer for ns.
.SH NOTES
As with all other programs in the CWP/SU package that use getpars,
(GET PARameters from the command line) a file filled with such
statments may be included via option par=parfile. In particular, a
parfile created by   "bhedtopar"  may be used as input for the program
"setbhed".
The binary header file that results from running segyread may have the
wrong byte order. You will need to use "swapbhed" to change the byte, order before applying this program.
