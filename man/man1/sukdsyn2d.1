.SH NOTES
This program takes a migrated seismic section and a set of travel time
tables generated using rayt2d for a specific background velocity model
and generates synthetic seismic data in the form of common shot gathers.
(Common offset gathers may be generated by using nxo=1.) (Demigration.)
This program is a tool which may be used for the migration residual
statics estimation technique of Tjan, Audebert, and Larner 1994.
1. The traveltime tables are generated by program rayt2d (or other ones)
on relatively coarse grids, with dimension ns*nxt*nzt. In the
modeling process, traveltimes are interpolated into shot/geophone
positions and migration section grids.
2. The input migration section must be an array of binary floats (no SU
headers).
3. The synthesized traces are output in common-shot gathers in SU format.
4. The memory requirement for this program is about
(ns*nxt*nzt+nx*nz+4*nr*nzt+3*nxt*nzt)*4 bytes
where nr = 1+min(nxt*dxt,0.5*offmax+aperx)/dxo.
