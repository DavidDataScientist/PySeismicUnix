.SH NAME
segyhdrs \- SEGYHDRS - make SEG-Y ascii and binary headers for segywrite
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B segyhdrs

\fBsegyhdrs\fR [ < sudata ] [optional parameters] [ > copy of sudata ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
SEGYHDRS - make SEG-Y ascii and binary headers for segywrite
.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
ns=  if no input trace header
dt=  if no input trace header
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
ns=tr.ns from header    number of samples on input traces
dt=tr.dt from header	sample rate (microseconds) from traces
bfile=binary		name of file containing binary block
hfile=header		name of file containing ascii block
Some binary header fields are set:
jobid=1			job id field
lino=1			line number (only one line per reel)
reno=1			reel number
format=1		data format
All other fields are set to 0, by default.
To set any binary header field, use sukeyword to find out
the appropriate keyword, then use the getpar form:
keyword=value	to set keyword to value
The header file is created as ascii and is translated to ebcdic
by segywrite before being written to tape.  Its contents are
formal but can be edited after creation as long as the forty
line format is maintained.
Caveat: This program has not been tested under XDR for machines
not having a 2 byte unsigned short integral data type.
