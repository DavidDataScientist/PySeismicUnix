sumigsplit \- SUMIGSPLIT - Split-step depth migration for zero-offset data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sumigsplit

\fBsumigsplit\fR <infile >outfile vfile= [optional parameters]
.SH DESCRIPTION
SUMIGSPLIT - Split-step depth migration for zero-offset data.
.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
nz=                   number of depth samples
dz=                   depth sampling interval
vfile=                name of file containing velocities
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
dt=from header(dt) or .004    time sampling interval
dx=from header(d2) or 1.0     midpoint sampling interval
ft=0.0                        first time sample
fz=                           first depth sample
tmpdir=        if non-empty, use the value as a directory path
prefix for storing temporary files; else if the
the CWP_TMPDIR environment variable is set use
its value for the path; else use tmpfile()
.SH NOTES
The input velocity file 'vfile' consists of C-style binary floats.
The structure of this file is vfile[iz][ix]. Note that this means that
the x-direction is the fastest direction instead of z-direction! Such a
structure is more convenient for the downward continuation type
migration algorithm than using z as fastest dimension as in other SU
programs.
Because most of the tools in the SU package (such as  unif2, unisam2,
and makevel) produce output with the structure vfile[ix][iz], you will
need to transpose the velocity files created by these programs. You may
use the SU program 'transp' in SU to transpose such files into the
required vfile[iz][ix] structure.
(In C  v[iz][ix] denotes a v(x,z) array, whereas v[ix][iz]
denotes a v(z,x) array, the opposite of what Matlab and Fortran
programmers may expect.)
