.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sugethw

\fBsugethw\fR key=key1,... [output=] <infile [>outfile]
.SH DESCRIPTION
SUGETHW - sugethw writes the values of the selected key words sugethw key=key1,... [output=] <infile [>outfile]
.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
key=key1,...		At least one key word.

output=ascii		output written as ascii for display
=binary for output as binary floats
=geom   ascii output for geometry setting
verbose=0 		quiet

line for each trace in the data set.
.SH EXAMPLES
sugethw <stdin key=sx,gx
writes sx, gx values as ascii trace by trace to the terminal.
Comment:
Users wishing to edit one or more header field (as in geometry setting)
may do this via the following sequence:
sugethw < sudata output=geom key=key1,key2,... > hdrfile
Now edit the ASCII file hdrfile with any editor, setting the fields
appropriately. Convert hdrfile to a binary format via:
a2b < hdrfile n1=nfields > binary_file
Then set the header fields via:
sushw < sudata infile=binary_file key=key1,key2,... > sudata.edited
