SUSWAPBYTES - SWAP the BYTES in SU data to convert data from big endian to little endian byte order, and vice versa

## Synopsis

```bash
suswapbytes < stdin [optional parameter] > sdtout
```

```
Caveat: this code has not been tested on DEC
```

## Notes

The 'native'	endian is the endian (byte order) of the machine you are
running this program on. The 'foreign' endian is the opposite byte order.
